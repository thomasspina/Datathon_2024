Item 1.           Security and Issuer
                  -------------------
                  This statement  relates to the Common Stock, no par value (the
"Common Stock") of Apple Computer, Inc. (the "Issuer").  The principal executive
offices of the Issuer are  located  at 1 Infinite  Loop,  Cupertino,  California
95014.

Item 2.           Identity and Background
                  -----------------------
                  This  statement  is being filed by His Royal  Highness  Prince
Alwaleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud ("HRH"), an individual,  whose business
address is Kingdom Holding Company,  P.O. Box 8653,  Riyadh,  11492,  Kingdom of
Saudi  Arabia.  HRH is a citizen  of the  Kingdom  of Saudi  Arabia.  HRH is the
founder and majority  owner of Kingdom  Holding  Company,  a Saudi Arabian based
corporation  with interests in Saudi Arabian banking,  real estate  development,
supermarkets, media and broadcasting and the travel industry.

                  HRH has not during the last five years been (i) convicted in a
criminal  proceeding  (excluding traffic violations or similar  misdemeanors) or
(ii) a party to a civil  proceeding  of a  judicial  or  administrative  body of
competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a
judgment,  decree and final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting
or mandating  activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding
any violation with respect to such laws.

                  This  statement  also  is  being  filed  by  Mustafa   Ibrahim
Al-Hejailan  ("Mr.  Al-Hejailan"),  an  individual,  whose  business  address is
Kingdom Holding Company,  P.O. Box 8653, Riyadh, 11492, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Mr. Al-Hejailan is a citizen of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and is the Executive
Director-International Office of Kingdom Holding Company.

                  Mr.  Al-Hejailan  has not  during the last five years been (i)
convicted in a criminal  proceeding  (excluding  traffic  violations  or similar
misdemeanors)  or  (ii)  a  party  to  a  civil  proceeding  of  a  judicial  or
administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding
was or is  subject  to a  judgment,  decree  and final  order  enjoining  future
violations  of, or  prohibiting  or mandating  activities  subject to federal or
state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws.

                  HRH  and Mr.  Al-Hejailan  may be  deemed  to be  acting  as a
"group" within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 with regard to the securities of the Issuer.

<PAGE>
Item 3.           Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration
                  -------------------------------------------------
                  HRH has acquired a total of  6,233,550  shares of Common Stock
of the Issuer which were purchased in transactions on the Nasdaq National Market
for an aggregate consideration of $115,417,000. The source of such consideration
was HRH's personal funds.

                  Mr. Al-Hejailan  acquired 2,500 shares of Common Stock in June
1993  for an  aggregate  consideration  of  $106,950.  On  April  7,  1997,  Mr.
Al-Hejailan  purchased a call option for an aggregate  consideration of $188,500
giving him the right to acquire 50,000 shares of the Issuer's  Common Stock (the
"Call Option").  The source of consideration for each of these  transactions was
Mr. Al-Hejailan's personal funds.

Item 4.           Purpose of Transaction
                  ----------------------
                  HRH's purpose in effecting the transactions  disclosed in this
statement was to acquire a significant  investment  position in the Issuer.  HRH
has been following the technology industry closely for some time, and the Issuer
in  particular  for a number of  months.  HRH  believes  that  there is  serious
potential for the Issuer to provide large returns to its  stockholders as it did
in the past. HRH intends to review the business, operations and prospects of the
Issuer further before  determining  any future courses of action or alternatives
with respect to HRH's investment.

                  HRH,  depending upon market  conditions and other factors,  in
the future, may acquire additional shares of Common Stock or dispose of all or a
portion of the Common Stock which HRH now owns or hereafter may acquire. HRH has
no  present  plans  or  proposals  that  relate  to,  or  would  result  in,  an
extraordinary   corporate  transaction  involving  the  Issuer  or  any  of  its
subsidiaries,  a sale or transfer of any of the Issuer's assets, a change in the
present Board of Directors or management of the Issuer,  a change in the present
capitalization  or dividend  policy of the Issuer,  any other material change in
the Issuer's business or corporate structure, changes in the Issuer's charter or
bylaws or with respect to the delisting or deregistration of any of the Issuer's
securities.

                  HRH,  however,  reserves  the  right to and may in the  future
change HRH's  purpose with respect to this  investment.  In this regard,  HRH is
aware of recent  press  reports  that Mr.  Lawrence  Ellison,  a Silicon  Valley
software  executive,  may  attempt to acquire  control of the  Issuer.  HRH will
monitor  events  closely  to see what  steps  are taken by Mr.  Ellison,  by the
Issuer's  current  management  or by others to improve  returns to the  Issuer's
stockholders.

<PAGE>

                  Mr. Al-Hejailan  acquired his 2,500 shares of Common Stock and
the Call Option for investment. Mr. Al-Hejailan entered into the two put options
described in Item 6 below because he believes that they are a good investment.

                  Mr.  Al-Hejailan,  depending upon market  conditions and other
factors, in the future, may acquire additional shares of Common Stock or dispose
of all or a  portion  of the  Common  Stock  which Mr.  Al-Hejailan  now owns or
hereafter may acquire.  Mr.  Al-Hejailan  has no present plans or proposals that
relate to, or would result in, an extraordinary  corporate transaction involving
the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries, a sale or transfer of any of the Issuer's
assets,  a change in the present Board of Directors or management of the Issuer,
a change in the present  capitalization  or dividend  policy of the Issuer,  any
other material change in the Issuer's business or corporate  structure,  changes
in  the  Issuer's  charter  or  bylaws  or  with  respect  to the  delisting  or
deregistration  of any of the Issuer's  securities.  Mr.  Al-Hejailan,  however,
reserves  the right to and may in the future  change his purpose with respect to
this investment.

Item 5.           Interest in Securities of the Issuer
                  ------------------------------------
                  On April 1, 1997, HRH purchased on the Nasdaq  National Market
4,300  shares of Common  Stock at a price of $17.55  per  share.  Such  purchase
caused HRH's beneficial  ownership to exceed 5% of the outstanding Common Stock.
As a result,  as of April 1, 1997,  HRH was the  beneficial  owner of  6,233,550
shares of Common Stock of the Issuer which  represents  approximately  5% of the
outstanding Common Stock. HRH has the sole power to vote (or to direct the vote)
and the sole power to dispose  (or to direct  the  disposition)  of all of these
shares.

                  HRH  has  engaged  in  following  other  transactions  in  the
Issuer's  Common Stock in the sixty days preceding the purchase  reported in the
preceding paragraph:

                  No person other than HRH has the right to receive or the power
to direct the receipt of dividends  from,  or the proceeds from the sale of, the
shares of Common Stock beneficially owed by HRH.

                  In June 1993, Mr. Al-Hejailan purchased 2,500 shares of Common
Stock of the Issuer. On April 7, 1997, Mr. Al-Hejailan purchased on the American
Stock  Exchange the Call Option giving him the right to acquire 50,000 shares of
Common Stock at a per share price of $20 per share.  The Call  Option,  which is
currently exercisable,  will expire in January 1998. Accordingly, as of April 7,
1997,  Mr.  Al-Hejailan  is deemed to  beneficially  own 52,500 shares of Common
Stock.  Mr.  Al-Hejailan  has the sole power to vote (or to direct the vote) and
the sole power to dispose (or to direct the disposition) of the 2,500 shares and
will have such sole power with  respect to the 50,000  shares if the Call Option
is exercised.  Except as described herein and in Item 6 below,  Mr.  Al-Hejailan
has not engaged in any other  transactions  in the Issuer's  Common Stock in the
sixty days preceding April 1, 1997.

                  No person other than Mr.  Al-Hejailan has the right to receive
or the power to direct the receipt of dividends  from,  or the proceeds from the
sale of, the shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by Mr. Al-Hejailan.

Item 6.           Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or
                  Relationships with Respect to Securities of the Issuer
                  ------------------------------------------------------

                  On April 1, 1997, Mr. Al-Hejailan sold a put option, (the "Put
Option") pursuant to which Mr. Al-Hejailan is obligated to purchase, if such Put
Option is exercised by the holder  thereof,  200,000 shares of Common Stock at a
per share price of $20.00 per share.  Mr.  Al-Hejailan  received an aggregate of
$825,000 for entering  into the Put Option.  On April 4, 1997,  Mr.  Al-Hejailan
sold a second  put option  (the  "Second  Put  Option"),  pursuant  to which Mr.
Al-Hejailan  is obligated to purchase,  if the Second Put Option is exercised by
the  holder  thereof,  100,000  shares of Common  Stock at a per share  price of
$15.00 per share. Mr. Al-Hejailan received an aggregate of $112,500 for entering
into the Second Put Option. Both the Put Option and the Second Put Option expire
in January 1998 and were sold on the American Stock Exchange.

                  Except   as   reported   above,   there   are  no   contracts,
arrangements,  understandings, or relationships (legal or otherwise) between HRH
and any  persons  with  respect to any  securities  of the Issuer or between Mr.
Al-Hejailan and any persons with respect to any securities of the Issuer.
